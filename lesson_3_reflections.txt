When would you want to create a repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When other people need to view or update the repository or I use the repository
  from several computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Somebody might have added new version of a file that I have modified in the local
  repository or somebody might have added "broken" code file to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is used to make a copy of a repository in GitHub. This is used when we wan't
to make a copy from a repository inside GitHub. 
Clone is used to make a local copy from a repository. Source repository can be a
local repository or a remote repository. Clone is used when we wan't to update 
some repository in own PC.
Branch is made inside of a one repository. Branch is used when we wan't to 
update one repository without affecting the master branch
 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 
You can see which commits have not yet been pushed to the remote repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without GitHub I would use shared directory for collaborating. Accessing files would be easier. Preventing simultaneous editing of same files would be harder.
