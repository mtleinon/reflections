When would you want to create a repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When other people need to view or update the repository or I use the repository
  from several computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Somebody might have added new version of a file that I have modified in the local
  repository or somebody might have added "broken" code file to the remote repository.
